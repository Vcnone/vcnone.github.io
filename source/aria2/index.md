# aria2 - The ultra fast download utility

## [Disclaimer](https://github.com/aria2/aria2#disclaimer)

This program comes with no warranty. You must use this program at your own risk.

## [Introduction](https://github.com/aria2/aria2#introduction)

aria2 is a utility for downloading files. The supported protocols are HTTP(S), FTP, SFTP, BitTorrent, and Metalink. aria2 can download a file from multiple sources/protocols and tries to utilize your maximum download bandwidth. It supports downloading a file from HTTP(S)/FTP/SFTP and BitTorrent at the same time, while the data downloaded from HTTP(S)/FTP/SFTP is uploaded to the BitTorrent swarm. Using Metalink's chunk checksums, aria2 automatically validates chunks of data while downloading a file like BitTorrent.
